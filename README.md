# Spiking Transformer
## Spiking  Convolutional  Vision Transformer - Pytorch

This code is created to train MNIST on Convolutional Spiking Neural Network model. It is known The tranformer does not work effeciently with small images like MNIST (28x28). it is just attempt to see how much this model will be effecient. In this work I used to main models SpykeTorch and convolution-vision-transformers. I get accuracy around 83% . Still the code under processing but  still you can run it
